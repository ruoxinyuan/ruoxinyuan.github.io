## Research Experience

### Research on Temporal Point Process  
**Dec 2024 – Feb 2025**  
- Introduced **Residual Events Decomposition (RED)**, the first TPP decomposition technique using a weight function to evaluate intensity and identify residual events.  
- Developed **Residual TPP**, a unified framework integrating statistical and neural TPPs to capture self-exciting patterns while reducing computational cost.  
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance and improved efficiency on multiple real-world datasets.

### Research on Process Data Analysis  
**Jun 2024 – Dec 2024**  
- Developed a framework for analyzing **Complex Problem Solving (CPS)** process data, predicting students’ progression toward correct answers in real time and summarizing results as probability curves.  
- Pioneered integration of deep learning models (GRU, Transformer) into CPS data analysis.  
- Demonstrated robustness and model-agnostic applicability of the probability curves on real PISA items, enabling downstream tasks (e.g., key-action identification, response-pattern discovery).  
- Released a user-friendly, scalable analytical framework with public code, requiring no expert preprocessing.

### Research on Conformal Prediction  
**Jan 2025 – Jun 2025**  
- Proved **β-mixing** properties for Hawkes processes with bounded excitation kernels, providing geometric decay bounds.  
- Theoretically analyzed **split conformal prediction (CP)** coverage guarantees for periodic temporal point processes.  
- Validated CP’s effectiveness in generating prediction intervals on both real and synthetic data, highlighting its coverage, simplicity, and speed advantages.

### Research on ℓ₀-Penalized VAR  
**May 2025 – Now**, San Diego, US  
- Investigated theoretical guarantees for ℓ₁-regularized least squares (LASSO) on high-dimensional, mixing time series.  
- Pioneered the first theoretical analysis of **Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT)** in the time-series context.  
- Conducted numerical simulations and real-data experiments demonstrating IHT’s efficacy in sparse VAR models.

## Internship Experience

### Machine Learning Research Intern  
**Pinnacle Investment Management, AI Research Group**, Shanghai, China  
**Dec 2023 – Jun 2024**  
- Developed high-frequency systematic trading strategies for stock-index futures using genetic programming; iterated 50+ times to optimize Sharpe ratio.  
- Explored statistical arbitrage with deep learning, constructing conditional factor models and extracting signals via a CNN + Transformer + FFN architecture.

### Quantitative Research Intern  
**Soochow Securities, Financial Engineering Group**, Shanghai, China  
**Jun 2023 – Dec 2023**  
- Researched industry-rotation strategies, developing a momentum indicator and applying XGBoost and LSTM.  
- Designed asset-allocation strategies for CSI 300 and high-grade credit bonds, implementing a logistic-regression-based trading system.
