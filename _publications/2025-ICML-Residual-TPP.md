excerpt: 'We introduce **Residual TPP**, a novel, unified, and lightweight approach that leverages the strengths of both classical temporal point processes (TPPs) and expressive neural TPPs to achieve superior performance. Specifically, we propose the **Residual Events Decomposition (RED)** technique for TPPs, which defines a weight function to quantify how well the intensity function captures the event characteristics. The RED serves as a flexible, plug-and-play module that can be integrated with any TPP model in a wide range of tasks.'
