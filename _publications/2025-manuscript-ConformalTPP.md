excerpt: 'We propose a **conformal prediction framework** tailored to temporal point processes, resolving challenges posed by their continuous-time nature, temporal dependence, and violation of exchangeability assumptions. We establish rigorous **coverage guarantees** under mild assumptions of periodic stationarity and $$\beta$$-mixing, and extend the theoretical results to Hawkes processes and non-periodic stationary processes.'
